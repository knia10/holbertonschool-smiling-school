<img src="https://mdbcdn.b-cdn.net/img/home/design-system.png" width = 400px length = 300px >__

In this project, you will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

Create an account in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and open these files:

[Homepage](https://www.figma.com/file/QYQqMYbdpAHL5xTclwJKSI/Homepage?node-id=0%3A1) - fig file
[Pricing] (https://www.figma.com/file/KLAI53jdYpfFNEy0O79ymB/Pricing)- fig file
[Courses](https://www.figma.com/file/ivg3abH1HLmMayBgjGg1Qf/Courses) - fig file
And “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

Important notes with Figma:

- 🔰 if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: [source-sans-pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT)
- 🔰 some values are in float - feel free to round them
- 🔰 “Be pixel perfect” - yes! but mainly make sure colors, size and position are correct. #C271FF is not purple.
For this task, please write an amazing `README.md`

#### Interactions note:

- 🔰 Web pages must switch to the tablet version when the screen width is 768px
- 🔰 Web pages must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 576px
- 🔰 button hover/active: `opacity: 0.9`
